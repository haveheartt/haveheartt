I'm a software engineer and I enjoy building complex systems that solves non-trivial problems. I'm also starting to get more interested in high energy physics and experiment with it in some of my repos. If you want to chat me find me on [My personal website](https://ubuntu-drab.vercel.app/), and if you want to discuss something with me or collaborate send me an email. Happy coding! 🚀

In my free time I like to contribute to open-source projects, here are some projects i contributed:
  - [Rust for Linux](https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/commit/9a02cbc5139e668f8b74e75a611d3a04b5241228)

I have solid experience with Rust, C++, C, Python, Java, Javascript, Go, PHP and cool stuff like Machine Learning, DevOps and React.
